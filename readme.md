 Trying to put together a code base which will have all the necessary libraries. 
 The idea is, if anyone wants to code a nice application be it for a tablet or for a phone, 
 they should be able to clone this repo and straight away start writing their business logic 
 rather than worrying about getting all the necessary libraries.
 This is inspired by awesome php.
